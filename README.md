| [`0x00-shell_basics`](https://github.com/aysuarex/alx-system_engineering-devops/tree/master/0x00-shell_basics)                            | It aims to learn about basics commands, navigation, files and directories in **Shell**                                                                                                                                         |
| [`0x01-shell_permissions`](https://github.com/aysuarex/alx-system_engineering-devops/tree/master/0x01-shell_permissions)                  | It aims to learn about man pages, permissions (owner, group and other) of files and directories in **Shell**                                                                                                                   |
| [`0x02-shell_redirections`](https://github.com/aysuarex/alx-system_engineering-devops/tree/master/0x02-shell_redirections)                | It aims to learn about how to handle standard input and output and how to combine commands and filters with redirections in **Shell**                                                                                          |
| [`0x03-shell_variable_expansions`](https://github.com/aysuarex/alx-system_engineering-devops/tree/master/0x03-shell_variables_expansions) | It aims to learn about alias builtin, help builtin, local, global and reserved variables (PATH, HOME and PS1), special parameters `$?` and single an double quotes in **Shell**                                                |
| [`Command Line for the win`](https://github.com/daveeazi/alx-system_engineering-devops/tree/master/command_line_for_the_win)                | CMD CHALLENGE is a pretty cool game challenging you on Bash skills. Everything is done via the command line and the questions are becoming increasingly complicated. Itâ€™s a good training to improve your command line skills! |

| [`Networking Basics`](https://github.com/daveeazi/alx-system_engineering-devops/tree/master/0x07-networking_basics)                | This project was the first of two introducing networking concepts. In this project, I answered a few quiz-like questions and wrote a couple bash scripts while learning about the OSI model, LAN and WAN networks, and TCP/UDP data transfer protocols. |
